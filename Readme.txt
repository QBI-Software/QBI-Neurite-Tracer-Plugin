Open FIJI, navigate to Help -> Update... and make sure the Neuroanatomy update site is ticked and is up to date.

Close FIJI.

Unzip the QBI Microscopy Neurite Tracer.zip package to your Fiji.app\Plugins folder.

Open FIJI, the new plugin QBI Microscopy Neurite Tracer should now be visible.

Navigate to Plugins -> QBI Microscopy Neurite Tracer -> QBI Microscopy Neurite Tracer and click to run.

Navigate to the directory of .tif images you want to analyse and press 'Select'.

There will be a dialog box titled 'Bulk Sholl Analysis (Tracings)' pop up for each cell with traced neurites. 

The 'OK' button should be automatically pressed by the script, however if you click away from the active window while running this automatic click will be missed. 

The 'OK' button can be pressed at any time after the dialog box has appeared, during tracing of subsequent images or in bulk at the end.

When all images are traced and analyses performed, close all open SNT tables.

You can then run again and navigate to a new folder for analysis.

A folder of 20 images should take ~5 minutes to perform the tracings.
